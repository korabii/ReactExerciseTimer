Timer
    The timer uses set interval to keep time, this means it will not be exact. the longer the time the higher the possibility the timer will be off by a second or two. If it is used in the intended 0-90 second range there will be little deviation.
Fix
    Use system time to figure out time passed between re-renders. (to-do - future update)
