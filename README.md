This Timer App was built entirely using generative AI via Vibe Coding, leveraging all the latest Pro models available at the time of development.

The final app turned out great and meets all the goals I set for it. However, the process came with several challenges and interesting lessons.

While Vibe Coding made it easy to generate and iterate on UI and logic, debugging issues introduced by AI proved extremely difficult.
For example, when the input fields began losing focus after every keystroke, it became impossible to fix the problem purely through AI. Regardless of which Pro model I used, the system would get stuck in a loop, repeatedly applying the same incorrect fix.

This experience showed that while AI-assisted coding is powerful for rapid prototyping, itâ€™s not yet reliable for long-term maintenance or fine-tuning complex functionality.
Ironically, this is an app I could have built in a single day manually, but it took two full days using Vibe Coding, largely due to repeated debugging cycles and model limitations.
